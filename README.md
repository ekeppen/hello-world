My first repository! (Also a tutorial)

Bio:
Hello! My name is Emmy and I've recently made the decision to study web design and development. 

I have a B.S in Biology and enjoyed the classes I took in C++ and Java. I went on to do communications for the political wing of labor unions, and taught myself HTML and CSS to make a few custom webpages for their website. I also learned Inkscape & GIMP to create custom graphics and banners. 

I currently live with my boyfriend who has shared with me the "good GNUws" about Linux and FOSS. When I'm not tuning up my Debian machine or studying, I like to play videogames and watch anime.
